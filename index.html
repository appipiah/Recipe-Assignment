				<h2>ðŸ¥„ Steps to make it</h2>
				<p>So, you have your ingredients. Now itâ€™s time to cook!</p>
				<ol>
			        <li><b>Gather your eggy team:</b> Round up all your ingredientsâ€”eggs, onions, peppers, seasoning
				        cube, curry, rosemary leaves, oil, plus any optional veggies or cheese.</li>
					
			        <li><b>Heat means go:</b> Drizzle a bit of oil into your frying pan and warm it over low heatâ€”gentle
				        is key!</li>
					
					<li><b>Onion first, flavors next:</b> Toss in most of the chopped onions (reserve a few for garnish)
						, crumble in the seasoning cube, plus curry and rosemary leaves. Fry on low heat for about 3
						minutes until fragrant and just turning golden.</li>
					
			        <li><b>Pepper party:</b> Pour in the chopped peppers and continue frying for around 2 minutes.
				        You want them lively and warmed, not mushy.</li>
					
					<li><b>Egg dive:</b> Whisk your eggs, then pour them into the pepper-onion mix. Stir gently to
						scramble, letting the egg set a bit before pushing it around. Cook until itâ€™s fully set and
						lightly fry-kissed.</li>
					
					<li><b>Season & dress up:</b> Add salt to taste. If youâ€™ve got veggies or cheese, sprinkle them
						in now and stir just enough to warm or melt them in. Thenâ€”voilÃ !</li>
