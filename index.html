				<ol>

						<p></p> <!-- This is to add space between the image and next list-->
					
			        <li><b>Sauté some Onions: </b> <br> Drizzle a bit of oil into your frying pan and warm it
				        over low heat; <br> Toss in most of the chopped onions (reserve a few for garnish),
				        crumble in the seasoning cube to taste; <br> Fry on low heat for about 3
				        minutes until fragrant and just turning golden.</li>

			        <li><b>Cook the Pepper:</b> <br> Pour in the chopped peppers and fry for about 2 minutes.
				        You want them lively and warmed, not mushy.</li>

					<li><b>Add Eggs: </b> <br> Pour your unwhisked eggs into the pepper-onion mix.
						Let the egg set a bit before stirring it gently to scramble; <br> Cook until it’s fully set and
						lightly fry-kissed. This should take about 3 minutes </li>

					<li><b>Season and Finish:</b> <br> Add salt to taste. If you’ve got veggies or cheese, sprinkle them
						in now and stir just enough to warm or melt them in. <br> Then, serve.</li>

			<!-- Things to Note section-->
			<section>
			    <h2>Things to Note</h2>
			    <ul>
				    <li>I prefer not to whisk my eggs before cooking; this gives them a chunkier, more textured feel.</li>
			        <li>You can use any type of pepper or onions. I prefer Bell peppers and red onions</li>
			        <li>If using cheese, add it just before the eggs finish cooking so it melts smoothly.</li>
			        <li>For a healthier option, substitute olive oil for vegetable oil.</li>
			        <li>Serve immediately for the best flavor.</li>
			  </ul>
